# Eagletcraft-1.12
Eagletcraft is a packaged and optimized version of Eaglercraft that runs exceptionally well on low end devices, such as chromebooks. This repository contains the latest stable version of Eagletcraft along with previous patches and the source (xml) file.

**HOW IT WORKS:** 
Eagletcraft 1.12 was made by distibuting the code of EaglercraftX 1.12 into many seperate hosted files. The files then all communicate via one html page where a line of code outputs the game on an inbuilt iframe. This leads to the offloading of static files (files that aren't currently being accessed) to your computer's flash memory, leading to a smooth, resource-minimal experience at the cost of in-game loading times.

**WHY IT WORKS:**
The reason Eagletcraft runs so well with low ram usage is because none of your computer's RAM is being wasted trying to update static files every tick (one-twentieth of a second).

**NOTICE:**
Unless you are in a situation where you cannot access the link, we recommend you play our constantly updating, cloud-connected OneCompiler edition of Eagletcraft instead of downloading the latest patch edition. https://onecompiler.com/html/43rjjm8te
